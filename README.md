Meet the Magical Tiger. He will be our guide through this journey, and help teach how to use this bitmap transformer. 

## The Spider Tiger Transform 
  Using the Reverse Image Vertical method, a user can return an upsidown version of their image!

  This method makes use of Java's bitwise operators to reverse the image at a base level. 
  
## The Mirrored Tiger Transform
  Using the Reverse Image Horziontal method, a user can return a horizontal flip of their image!

This method makes use of Java's bitwise operators to reverse the image at a base level. 

## Fuzzify Tiger Transform 
  By dividing the pixel values by 2, our user can create that grainy 80's television realness on their favorite .bmp!

  This method targets the RGB values in the user's bmp and divides them by 2.
  
## Invert Tiger Transform 
 Using the Invert method, a user can invert the colors on their image - creating a stunning photo negative version.

  This method uses bitwise inversion to convert the colors from what you expect, to what you really really dont. 
  
  Why would you do any of this to a tiger?
